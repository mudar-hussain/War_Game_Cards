# War_Game_Cards

Intro:

The project was created implementing __Classes__, __OOP__ techniques, and lists.
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down, in front of him.

The Play:

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack. If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (8 cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another three cards face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 16 cards, and so on.
